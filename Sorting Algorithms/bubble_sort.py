# Algorithm :-

# Start with the first element in the array.
# Compare the current element with the next element.
# If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
# Move to the next element and repeat steps 2â€“3 until the end of the array.
# Repeat, the whole process for all elements, largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array with each pass.
# Continue until no more swaps are needed.
